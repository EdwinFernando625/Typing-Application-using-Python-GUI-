# Typing Application using Python
This is a basic Typing Application a python project developed using the tkinter python library. The application upon every new start or on clicking the reset button would generate random one line sentences. When the start button is clicked the cursor automatically focuses into the entry-box provided and now the user can start typing. If the user has finished typing then he/she can either press the enter button or click on the stop button and the typing result will be displayed. The application also contains a login window in which you can enter your name and it will be displayed in the main typing window or else the word ‘Guest’ will be displayed.
